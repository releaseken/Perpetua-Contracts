#![no_std]
//! # Archival probe — **not part of the product**
//!
//! This contract exists for exactly one reason: to prove, against a real
//! network, the one thing Perpetua's unit tests structurally cannot.
//!
//! ## What it is for
//!
//! The SDK's test host runs storage in recording mode, where reading an expired
//! persistent entry is silently auto-restored rather than failing. So the unit
//! suite proves that crossing the archive/restore boundary preserves accounting,
//! but it never sees the live-network sequence:
//!
//! ```text
//!   read archived entry  ->  transaction FAILS
//!   resubmit with RestoreFootprint
//!   read again           ->  succeeds, data intact
//! ```
//!
//! See `docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md` §1.
//!
//! ## Why a separate contract
//!
//! Perpetua floors every stream entry's TTL at 30 days, and the network floors
//! *any* persistent entry at `min_persistent_ttl` — 120,960 ledgers, about 7
//! days, on both testnet and local quickstart. A real Perpetua stream therefore
//! cannot archive for a month.
//!
//! This probe deliberately does the one thing Perpetua never does: it writes a
//! persistent entry and **never extends its TTL**. The entry then lives exactly
//! `min_persistent_ttl` and archives as early as the network permits. The
//! restore mechanism it exercises is identical for any persistent entry — it is
//! a property of the ledger, not of the contract — so proving it here proves it
//! for `DataKey::Stream(id)`.
//!
//! ## What it deliberately does not do
//!
//! No auth, no tokens, no value of any kind. It holds a single symbol. If it
//! archives and is never restored, nothing is lost. Do not build on it, and do
//! not deploy it to mainnet.
//!
//! ## Release isolation (issue #1543)
//!
//! This probe is a workspace member but is **not** part of the deployable product
//! contract list. It stays a member so its smoke test remains wired into the
//! standard workspace checks (`cargo test --workspace`, `cargo fmt --all`,
//! `cargo clippy --all-targets`), but `script/release.sh` — the only command that
//! produces release artifacts — builds **only** the `fluxora-stream` package and
//! rejects any probe wasm among its outputs. To build this probe explicitly, use:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo build -p fluxora-archival-probe --target wasm32v1-none --release
//! ```
//!
//! and for the live-network round trip, `script/archival-canary.sh`.
