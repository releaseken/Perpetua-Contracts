#![no_std]
//! # Perpetua — continuous payment streaming for Soroban
//!
//! Lock tokens once; have them accrue continuously to a recipient over time.
//! The recipient pulls their accrued balance whenever they like.
//!
//! This contract is a *primitive*, not an application. Payroll tools, grant
//! programs, subscription billing and vesting schedules are meant to be built
//! on top of it. Every scoping decision below favours generality on chain and
//! pushes convenience to the SDK.
//!
//! ## Pull-based by necessity
//!
//! Stellar has no scheduler — no cron, no keeper network, no way for a contract
//! to wake itself up. Every state change must be triggered by an external
//! transaction. So nothing here runs in the background: the recipient calls
//! [`FluxoraStream::withdraw`] and the contract computes what they have earned
//! at that instant.
//!
//! ## No on-chain stream discovery
//!
//! There is deliberately no per-user list of stream ids in storage. A `Vec<u64>`
//! of a treasury's streams grows without bound, costs rent forever, and blows
//! Soroban's per-transaction footprint limit once that treasury has a few
//! hundred recipients. On chain, a stream is only ever addressed by its `u64`
//! id. `test::resource_limits` states the payoff as a test: the 153rd stream
//! costs exactly what the 2nd did.
//!
//! Discovery is an off-chain concern: [`create_stream`](FluxoraStream::create_stream)
//! returns the new id and emits an event carrying sender, recipient and every
//! schedule field, so an indexer can answer "show me my streams" without the
//! contract paying rent to remember.
//!
//! ## Immutable guarantees
//!
//! `cancellable`, `pausable` and `transferable` are fixed at creation and can
//! never change afterwards. This is a trust feature: before accepting a stream a
//! recipient can verify that the sender cannot claw it back, freeze it, or
//! reassign it. A stream that could *become* cancellable later would be
//! worthless as a guarantee.
//!
//! For the same reason the contract has no admin key, no upgrade path, no fee
//! switch and no global pause. Immutability is what lets another protocol depend
//! on this one.

///
/// Measured evidence from the release resource suite (20-stream batch):
///
/// | limit | used by a 20-stream batch | ceiling |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | total footprint (entries) | 51 | 400 |

/// | instructions | ~5.8M | 400M |
/// | **contract event bytes** | **10,240** | **16,384** |

/// budget* allows about 32, because each stream emits a `withdrawn` event plus
/// the token contract's own `transfer` event — roughly 512 bytes per stream
/// between them.
///
/// Sixteen is that measured ceiling with a 2x safety factor. The margin is not
/// decoration: the per-stream event cost depends on the *token's* event
/// payload, and a token heavier than the Stellar Asset Contract used in the
