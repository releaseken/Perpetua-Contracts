//! Stage 3 — arithmetic overflow safety at maximum configuration values.
//!
//! Issue #1552. The accrual helpers operate on `u64` ledger/time values and
//! `i128` amounts. At the maximum supported configuration values — `u64`-wide
//! timestamps and durations, and deposits large enough that `deposit * duration`
//! presses against the `i128` ceiling — a single plain `+` / `*` / `-` could
//! wrap silently, and a host panic on an unchecked division by zero or an
//! overflowed cast would surface as an **opaque host trap** instead of a typed
//! [`crate::Error`].
//!
//! The chosen design is **checked arithmetic in the accrual helpers combined
//! with a bounded domain enforced at creation**:
//!
//! * Every arithmetic helper (`stream_time`, `duration`, `elapsed`,
//!   `withdrawable`, `refundable`, `liability`) saturates or `checked_`
//!   fails rather than wrapping.
//! * `vested` guards its one real multiplication (`deposited * consumed`)
//!   with `checked_mul` mapped to [`Error::Overflow`], and `create_stream`
//!   front-loads that same guard against `deposit * duration` so the accrual
//!   multiplication can never overflow for a stream that ever reached storage.
//! * `top_up` re-establishes both guards against its post-extension figures.
//!
//! These tests pin the boundary down: they drive `accrual` directly (the way
//! `test::props` does, microseconds per case and no host) at the widest
//! timestamps and the largest deposits `create_stream` would accept, and they
//! drive the real contract at `u64`-wide timestamps to confirm the views and
//! lifecycle stay typed — no wrap, no division-by-zero, no opaque host trap.
//!
//! The one thing that must *never* happen on any of these inputs is a panic.
//! An `Err(Error::Overflow)` (or an `Ok` with a bounded value) is correct and
//! expected; a trap is the bug this file exists to catch.
