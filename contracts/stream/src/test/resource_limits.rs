//! Stage 3 — resource consumption.
//!
//! Any design that iterates over a growing collection works fine with five
//! streams and fails in production with five hundred, so the batch cap has to
//! be justified by measurement rather than by a guess. These tests print what
//! they measure and assert headroom against it.
//!
//! # The limits that actually bind, on protocol 27
//!
//! The familiar "roughly 200 ledger entry reads" figure predates protocol 23.
//! Since then live Soroban state is held in memory, and the read limit that
//! survives (`disk_read_entries`, still 200) counts only entries restored from
//! disk plus non-Soroban entries such as classic account balances — for a
//! contract touching live state it is usually zero.
//!
//! What binds instead, from the mainnet snapshot the SDK enforces:
//!
//! | limit | value |
//! |---|---|
//! | `ledger_entries` (total footprint: disk reads + memory reads + writes) | 400 |
//! | `write_entries` | 200 |
//! | `instructions` | 400,000,000 |
//! | `contract_events_size_bytes` | 16,384 |
//!
//! The footprint total is the real ceiling on batch size, and the event budget
//! is the one people forget — a batch emitting one event per stream can run out
//! of event bytes before it runs out of entries.
//!
//! # What each measurement covers
//!
//! Every invocation here reports and then bounds four resource dimensions:
//!
//! * **CPU** — `instructions`, the modelled CPU instruction count.
//! * **Disk reads** — `disk_read_entries`, entries restored from disk. Live
//!   contract state must keep this at zero under Protocol 27.
//! * **Memory** — `memory_read_entries`, the in-memory ledger entries accessed
//!   (live Soroban state is held in memory, not re-read from disk).
//! * **Storage writes** — `write_entries`, the entries written to the ledger.
//!
//! The deterministic max/max+1 boundary tests below assert *all four* at the
//! cap, and that one past the cap is rejected with [`Error::BatchTooLarge`]
//! before any partial mutation.
//!
//! # Caveats on the numbers
//!
//! * These contracts are registered natively, so Wasm instantiation and
//!   execution costs are skipped and measured *instructions* understate a real
//!   deployment. Entry counts, which is what the cap is about, are accurate.
//! * The mainnet limits are enforced by default on every invocation here, so
//!   anything that would be rejected on-network fails the test outright rather
//!   than merely reporting a large number.
//! * The limits are a snapshot taken when the SDK was published, not a live
//!   query. An SDK upgrade can move them; that is one more reason this file
//!   exists.
