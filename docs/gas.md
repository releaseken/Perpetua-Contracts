# Factory gas benchmark

The factory benchmark compares three first-stream creation paths under the same Stellar Asset Contract, schedule, amount, and ledger state:

1. `direct`: `FluxoraStream::create_stream` without a wrapper.
2. `forwarding`: a contract that forwards the same arguments to `FluxoraStream` without factory policy checks.
3. `factory`: `FluxoraFactory::create_stream`, including the consolidated policy read, policy checks, and stream dispatch.

The forwarding path is the control for cross-contract dispatch. The issue's policy-overhead budget is measured as `factory - forwarding`, while `factory - direct` is also logged as total wrapper overhead.

## Measured result

Measured on 2026-09-24 with Rust 1.97.1, soroban-sdk 27.0.6, and soroban-env-host 27.0.1:

| Path | CPU instructions | Memory bytes | Memory reads | Writes | Write bytes | Event bytes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Direct | 276,074 | 42,583 | 8 | 5 | 1,228 | 684 |
| Forwarding control | 299,465 | 46,688 | 9 | 5 | 1,228 | 684 |
| Factory | 327,424 | 51,221 | 9 | 5 | 1,228 | 684 |

- Policy overhead: `327,424 - 299,465 = 27,959` instructions, or **9.34%** of forwarding stream creation.
- Total wrapper overhead: `327,424 - 276,074 = 51,350` instructions, or **18.60%** of direct creation. This includes the forwarding contract invocation itself and is reported separately rather than attributed to policy validation.
- The factory adds one in-memory policy read and no stream-ID vector read or write. Rate division and bounds checks are skipped when both optional rate bounds are unset.

## Reproduce

From `contracts/factory`:

```bash
cargo test --locked --test gas_benchmark -- --nocapture --test-threads=1
```

The benchmark registers all contracts natively. As with the existing resource-limit suite, this is a deterministic policy and storage regression test; Wasm execution costs are lower than production. A release-Wasm or testnet simulation run is still required before treating the absolute instruction counts as deployment forecasts.
